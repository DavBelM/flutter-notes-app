## Notes CRUD Operations (4 minutes)

### Empty State
**[Show empty notes screen]**
- "When there are no notes, users see an encouraging empty state message."
- "This provides clear direction on what to do next."

### Create Notes
**[Add multiple notes with different categories]**
- "Let's create some notes. I'll add a work note first."
- "Notice the category selection - Work, Personal, Ideas, etc."
- "Each category has its own color scheme for better organization."

### Firebase Firestore Verification
**[Open Firebase Console - Firestore]**
- "Let's check Firebase Firestore to see our data in real-time."
- "You can see the notes collection with our newly created documents."
- "Each note is associated with the authenticated user's ID for security."

### Read/Display Notes
**[Return to app]**
- "Back in the app, notes are displayed with their categories and timestamps."
- "The UI uses beautiful gradient backgrounds and modern card designs."

### Update Notes
**[Edit existing notes]**
- "Let's edit this note. I'll change the content and category."
- "The update is instant and syncs with Firebase immediately."

### Firebase Real-time Sync
**[Show Firestore console updating in real-time]**
- "Watch the Firebase console - you can see the changes reflected immediately."
- "This demonstrates the real-time synchronization capability."

### Delete Notes
**[Delete notes with confirmation]**
- "For deletion, the app asks for confirmation to prevent accidental loss."
- "Once confirmed, the note is removed from both the app and Firebase."

---

## Technical Architecture (1 minute)
**[Show code structure briefly]**

"This app follows clean architecture principles with separate layers for:
- Presentation: UI and BLoC state management
- Data: Repository pattern and Firebase services
- Core: Shared utilities and themes

The BLoC pattern ensures reactive state management throughout the app."

---

## Error Handling Demo (1 minute)
**[Show network error or validation error]**

"The app includes comprehensive error handling. For example, if network connectivity is lost, users receive appropriate feedback. Form validation provides immediate visual feedback for better user experience."
